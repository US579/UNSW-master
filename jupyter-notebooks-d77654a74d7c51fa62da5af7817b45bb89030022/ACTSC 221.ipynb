    "## Nominal Rates of Interest\n",
    "\n",
    "So far, our examples of compound interest assume that the interest is received and reinvested at the end of each year.\n",
    "\n",
    "In many cases, the actual frequency of interest payments may be more often than annually.  \n",
    "For example, many bank accounts pay interest at the end of each month, so the interest received is reinvested monthly.\n",
    "\n",
    "In such an instance, we would say that the interest on the account **compounds monthly**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notation $i^{(m)}$ to mean a **nominal**, or **stated annual rate** compounded $m$ times per year.  \n",
    "Ex. $i^{(2)} = 10\\%$ means the nominal rate is 10%, compound semi-annually.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, $\\$1$ invested at $i^{(m)}$ will receive interest at a rate of $\\frac{i^{(m)}}{m}$, $m$ times per year (received at the end of each $\\frac{1}{m^{\\text{th}}}$ of a year.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, an initial principal, $P$, will accumulate to a final value, $A$, when invested at $i^{(m)}$ for $n$ periods to\n",
    "$$A = P\\left(1 + \\frac{i^{(m)}}{m}\\right)^{n}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Equivalent Rates\n",
    "\n",
    "Two rates are **equivalent** if a given amount of principal invested for the same length of time at either rate produces the same accumulated values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we have $i^{(4)} = 10\\%$, then to find the equivalent annual rate of interest $i^{(1)}$, we solve for\n",
    "$$\\left(1 + \\frac{i^{(4)}}{4}\\right)^{4} = \\left(1 + \\frac{10\\%}{4}\\right)^{4} = 1 + i^{(1)}$$\n",
    "So we have $i^{(1)} = 10.381289\\%$.\n",
    "\n",
    "This annually compounded rate that is equivalent to the given nominal rate is called the **effective annual rate** (**EAR**).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Varying Rates\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose $\\$200$ in invested in an account that pays $i^{(1)}=5\\%$, for the first 2 years, followed by $i^{(1)}=8\\%$ for the next 3 years...  \n",
    "By splitting this, $A(2)$ is computed by\n",
    "$$A(2) = 200(1+0.05)^{2}$$\n",
    "And that $A(5)$ is thus computed by\n",
    "$$A(5) = A(2)(1+0.08)^{3}$$\n",

    "As compounding frequency _increases_, equivalent rates _decrease_ because we will get more times that the interest will be included into subsequent interest calculation.\n",

    "If a given option is better than another option to one focal point, it will be better at any focal point!\n",
    "\n",
    "A common focal date to select is in fact now, or time 0.  \n",
    "In this case, the time value is the _present value_.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Method 3 (Time 0)\n",
    "\n",
    "Calculating the present value of both options...  \n",
    "We have\n",
