    "## What is security\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of computers, usually means:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **C**confidentiality\n",
    "    * Access to systems or data is limited to authorized parties\n",
    "2. **I**ntegrity\n",
    "    * Receive the \"right\" data\n",
    "3. **A**vailability\n",
    "    * System or data is there when needed\n",
    "\n",
    "A computing system is _usually_ said to be secure if it has all three properties.\n",

    "### Security and reliability\n",
    "\n",
    "Security goes hand in hand with \"reliability.\"  \n",
    "A secure system can be relied on to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Keep personal data confidential\n",
    "2. Allow only authorized access or modifications to resources\n",
    "3. Ensrue that any prouced results are correct\n",
    "4. Give correct and meaningful results _on demand_\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is privacy\n",
    "\n",
    "A useful definition of privacy: \"informational self-determination\"\n",
    "\n",
    "* _user_ gets to _control_ information _about ther user_\n",
    "* \"Control\" means:\n",

    "\n",
    "Sometimes people places security and privacy as if they're opposing forces.  \n",

    "\n",
    "## Who are the adversaries\n",

    "## Secure programs\n",
    "\n",
    "Why is it so hard to write secure programs?  \n",
    "A simple answer:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Axiom (Murphy): programs have bugs\n",
    "* Corollary: security-relevant programs have security bugs\n",
    "\n",
    "## Flaw, faults, and failures\n",
    "\n",
    "A **flaw** is a problem in a program.  \n",
    "A **security flaw** is a problem that affects security in some way; confidentiality, integrity, and availability.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Flaws come in two types: **faults** and **failures**.\n",
    "\n",
    "A **fault** is a mistake, \"behind the scenes\"\n",
    "\n",
    "* An error in the code, data, specification, process, etc.\n",
    "* A fault is a **potential problem**\n",
    "\n",
    "A **failure** is when something _actually_ goes wrong\n",
    "\n",
    "* You log in to the library’s web site, and it shows you someone else’s account\n",
    "* \"Goes wrong\" means a deviation from the desired behaviour, not necessarily from the specified behaviour!\n",
    "    * The specification itself may be wrong\n",
    "\n",
    "A fault is the programmer/specifier/inside view.  \n",
    "A failure is the user/outside view.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Finding and fixing faults\n",
    "\n",
    "How do you find a fault?\n",
    "\n",
    "* If a user experiences a failure, you can try to work backwards to uncover the underlying fault\n",
    "* What about faults that haven't (yet) led to failures?\n",
    "* Intentionally try to _cause_ failures, then proceed as above\n",
    "    * Think like an attacker!\n",
    "\n",
    "Fixing faults:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Usually by making small edits (**patches**) to the program; this process is \"penetrate and patch\"\n",
    "* ex. Microsoft's \"Patch Tuesday\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problems with patching\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes patching makes things _worse_!\n",
    "\n",
    "* Pressure to patch a fault is often high, causing a narrow focus on the observed failure, instead of a broad look at what may be a more serious underlying problem\n",
    "* The fault may have caused other, unnoticed failures, and a partial fix may cause inconsistencies or other problem\n",
    "* The patch for this fault may be introducing new faults\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatives to patching?\n",
    "\n",
    "* Very difficult... How can programmers inform the users in the best way possible to avoid exposing the fault\n",
    "\n",
    "### Unexpected behaviour\n",
    "\n",
    "When a behaviour is specified, the spec usually lists the things the program must do; e.g.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `ls` must list the names of the files in the directory whose name is given, if the user has permissions to read that directory\n",
    "\n",
    "Most implementors wouldn't care if it did additional things as well\n",
    "\n",
    "* Sorting the list alphabetically before outputting them is fine\n",
    "\n",
    "But from a security/privacy point of view, extra behaviour could be bad\n",
    "\n",
    "* After displaying the filenames, post the list to a public web site\n",
    "* After displaying the filenames, delete the files\n",
    "\n",
    "When implementing a security or privacy relevant program, you should consider \"and nothing else\" to be implicitly added to the spec\n",
    "\n",
    "* \"should do\" vs. \"shouldn't do\"\n",
    "* Testing for \"shouldn't do\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### Types of security flaws\n",
    "\n",
    "A way to divide up security flaws is be genesis (where they came from).\n",
    "\n",
    "Some flaws are **intentional**/**inherent**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Malicious** flaws are intentionally inserted to attack systems, either in general, or certain systems in particular\n",
    "    * If it's meant to attack some particular system, we call it a targeted malicious flaw\n",
    "    * Otherwise, it's a general flaw\n",
    "* **Nonmalicious** (but intentional or inherent) flaws are often features that are meant to the be in the system, and are correctly implemented, but nonetheless can cause a failure when used by an attacker\n",
    "\n",
    "Most security flaws are caused by **unintentional** program errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Unintentional security flaw\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Heartbleed bug in OpenSSL (April 2014)\n",
    "\n",
    "The **TLS Heartbeat mechanism** is designed to keep SSL/TLS connections alive even when no data is being transmitted.  \n",
    "Heartbeat messages sent by one peer contain random data and a payload length.  \n",
    "The other peer is suppose to respond with a mirror of exactly the same data.\n",
    "\n",
    "User $\\rightarrow$ server:  \n",
    "`Type | Length | Payload`  \n",
    "e.g. `HB_RQST | 64KB | H`\n",
    "\n",
    "Relevant [xkcd](http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/heartbleed_explanation.png).\n",
    "\n",
    "There was a **missing bounds check**!  \n",
    "An attacker can request that a TLS server hand over a relatively large slice (up to 64KB) of its private memory space.  \n",
    "This is the _same_ memory space where OpenSSL also stores the server's private key material as well as TLS session keys.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Apple's SSL/TLS bug (February 2014)\n",
    "\n",
    "The bug occurs in the code used to check the validity of the server's signature on a key used in an SSL/TLS connection.  \n",
    "Bug existed in certain versions of OSX 10.9 and iOS 6.1 and 7.0.  \n",
    "An attacker (\"man in the middle\") could potentially exploit the flaw to get a user to accept a counterfeit key chosen by the attacker.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Buggy Code\n",
    "\n",
    "```swift\n",
    "static OSStatus\n",
    "SSLVerifySignedServerKeyExchange(SSLContext *ctx, bool isRsa, SSLBuffer signedParams,\n",
    "                                 uint8_t *signature, UInt16 signatureLen)\n",
    "{\n",
    "    OSStatus        err;\n",
    "    ...\n",
    "\n",
    "    if ((err = SSLHashSHA1.update(&hashCtx, &serverRandom)) != 0)\n",
    "        goto fail;\n",
    "    if ((err = SSLHashSHA1.update(&hashCtx, &signedParams)) != 0)\n",
    "        goto fail;\n",
    "        goto fail;\n",
    "    if ((err = SSLHashSHA1.final(&hashCtx, &hashOut)) != 0)\n",
    "        goto fail;\n",
    "    ...\n",
    "\n",
    "fail:\n",
    "    SSLFreeBuffer(&signedHashes);\n",
    "    SSLFreeBuffer(&hashCtx);\n",
    "    return err;\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "The are two consecutive `goto fail` statements!  \n",
    "The second `goto fail` statement is always executed _if_ the first two checks succeeded.  \n",
    "In this case, the third check is bypassed and $0$ is returned as the value of `err`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Types of unintentional flaws\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Buffer overflows\n",
    "\n",
    "Most commonly exploited type of security flaw.\n",
    "\n",
    "Upshot: if the attacker can write data past the end of an array on the stack, attacker can _usually_ overwrite things like the saved return address.  \n",
    "When the function returns, it will jump to any address of the attacker's choosing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Targets: programs on a local machine that run with setuid (superuser) privileges, or a network daemons on a remote machine.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Kinds of buffer overflows\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to the classic attack which overflows a buffer on the stack to jump to shellcode, there are many variants:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Attack which work when a **single byte** can be written past the end of the buffer (often caused by a common off-by-one error)\n",
    "* Overflows or buffers on the heap instead of the stack\n",
    "* Jump to other parts of the program, or parts of standard libraries, instead of shellcode\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Defences against buffer overflows\n",
    "\n",
    "Programmer: use a language with bounds checking\n",
    "\n",
    "* Also catch those exceptions\n",
    "\n",
    "Compiler: place padding between data and return address (\"canaries\")\n",
    "\n",
    "* Detect if the stack has been overwritten before the return from each function\n",
    "\n",
    "Memory: non-executable stack\n",
    "\n",
    "* \"W$\\oplus$X\" (memory page is either writable or executable, but never both)\n",
    "\n",
    "OS: stack (and sometimes code, heap, libraries) at random virtual addresses for each process\n",
    "\n",
    "* All mainstream OSes do this\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Integer overflows\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine integers represents a finite set of numbers.  \n",
    "This may not correspond to a programmer's mental model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose Program assumes that integer is always positive, overflow will make (signed) integer wrap and become negative, which will violate assumption!\n",
    "\n",
    "* Program casts large unsigned integers to signed integer\n",
    "* Result of a mathematical operation causes overflow\n",
    "\n",
    "Attack can pass values to program that will trigger overflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Format string vulnerabilities\n",
    "\n",
    "Class of vulnerabilities discovered only in 2000.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfiltered user input is used as format string in `printf()`, `fprintf()`, `sprintf()`, ...  \n",
    "e.g. `printf(buffer)` instead of `printf(\"%s\", buffer)`\n",
    "\n",
    "* `printf(buffer)` will parse buffer for %'s and use whatever is currently on the stack to process found format parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "`printf(\"%s%s%s%s\")` likely crashes your program.  \n",
    "`printf(\"%x%x%x%x\")` dumps parts of the stack.  \n",
    "`%n` will **write** to an address found on the stack.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Example expansion code\n",
    "\n",
    "```c\n",
    "char output [44];\n",
    "char buffer [44];\n",
    "\n",
    "snprintf(buffer, sizeof(buffer), \"Input %s\", input);\n",
    "sprintf(output, buffer);\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "What happens if input=%48d+(address of a libc routine)?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Incomplete mediation\n",
    "\n",
    "Inputs to programs are often specified by untrusted users,\n",
    "\n",
    "* web-based applications are a common example\n",
    "\n",
    "Users sometimes mistype data in web forms, e.g.:\n",
    "\n",
    "* phone number: 51998884567\n",
    "* email: sross#uwaterloo.ca\n",
    "\n",
    "The web application needs to ensure that what the user has entered constitutes a **meaningful** request.  \n",
    "This is called **mediation**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Incomplete mediation occurs when the application accepts incorrect data from the user.  \n",
    "Sometimes this is hard to avoid, e.g. `519-886-4567` as a phone number which is a reasonable entry.\n",
    "\n",
    "Focus on catching entries that are clearly wrong, e.g.:\n",
    "\n",
    "* not well formed; DOB: 1980-04-31\n",
    "* unreasonable values; DOB: 1876-10-12\n",
    "* inconsistent with other entries\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Why do we care?\n",
    "\n",
    "Security concerns:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Buffer overflow\n",
    "* SQL injection; [relevant xkcd](https://xkcd.com/327/)\n",
    "\n",
    "Any user-supplied input falls within well-specified values, known to be safe.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Client-side mediation\n",
    "\n",
    "There are some web sites with form that do **client-side** mediation (via Javascript).  \n",
    "If invalid data is entered, a popup will prevent the user from submitting it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Related issues: client-side state\n",
    "\n",
    "* Many web sites rely on the client to keep state for them\n",
    "* They will put hidden fields in the form which are passed back to the server when the user submits the form\n",
    "\n",
    "Problem: what if the user\n",
    "\n",
    "* turns off Javascript\n",
    "* edits the form before submitting it\n",
    "* writes a script that interacts with the web server instead of using a web browser at all\n",
    "* connects to the server \"manually\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the user can send arbitrary (unmediated) values to the server this way.  \n",
    "The user can also modify any client-side state.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Defences against incomplete mediation\n",
    "\n",
    "Client-side mediation is an okay method to use in order to have a friendlier user interface, but is useless for security purposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**server-side mediation** is required regardless of whether client-side mediation is used.\n",
    "\n",
    "For values entered by the user:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Always check carefully on the values of all fields\n",
    "* These values can potentially contain completely arbitrary 8-bit data (including accented chars, control chars, etc.) and by of any length\n",
    "\n",
    "For state stored by the client:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Ensure client has not modified the data in any way\n",
    "\n",
    "#### TOCTTOU errors\n",
    "\n",
    "TOCTTOU (\"TOCK-too\") errors\n",
    "\n",
    "* Time-Of-Check To Time-Of-Use\n",
    "* Also known as \"race condition\" errors\n",

    "* The system verifies the user is allowed to perform the action\n",
    "* The system performs the action\n",
    "\n",
    "What happens if the state of the system changes between steps 2 and 3?\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Example problem\n",
    "\n",
    "A particular Unix terminal program is `setuid` (runs with superuser privileges) so that it can allocate terminals to users (a privileged operation).\n",
    "\n",
    "It supports a command to write the contents of the terminal to a log file.  \n",
    "It first checks if the user has permissions to write to the requested file; if so, it opens the file for writing.\n",
    "\n",
    "The attacker makes a symbolic link:  \n",
    "`logfile -> file_she_owns`\n",
    "\n",
    "Between the \"check\" and the \"open\", the attacker changes it\n",
    "`logfile -> /etc/passwd`\n",
    "\n",
    "The state of the system _changed_ between the check for permission and the execution of the operation.  \n",
    "The file whose permissions were checked for writeability by the user (`file_she_owns`) wasn't (`/etc/passwd`).\n",
    "\n",
    "Can the attacker really \"win this race\"? **Yes**.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Defences against TOCTTOU errors\n",
    "\n",
    "When performing a privileged action on behalf of another party, make sure all information relevant to the access control decisions is **constant** between the time of the check and the time of the action (\"the race\")\n",

    "## Malicious code: Malware\n",
    "\n",
    "Various forms of software written with malicious content.  \n",
    "A common characteristic is that it needs to be executed in order to cause harm.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ways a malware get executed:\n",
    "\n",
    "* User action\n",
    "    * Downloading and running malicious software\n",
    "    * Viewing a web page containing malicious code\n",
    "    * Opening an executable email attachment\n",
    "    * Inserting a CD/DVD or USB flash drive\n",
    "* Exploiting an existing flaw in a system\n",
    "    * Buffer overflows in network daemons\n",
    "    * Buffer overflows in email clients or web browser\n",
    "\n",
    "### Types of malware\n",
    "\n",
    "* Virus\n",
    "    * Malicious code that adds itself to benign programs/files\n",
    "    * Code for spreading + code for actual attack\n",
    "    * _Usually_ activated by users\n",
    "* Worms\n",
    "    * Malicious code spreading with no or little user involvement\n",
    "* Trojans\n",
    "    * Malicious code hidden in seemingly innocent program that you downloaded\n",
    "* Logic Bombs\n",
    "    * Malicious code hidden in programs already on your machine\n",
    "\n",
    "### Virus\n",
    "\n",
    "A **virus** is a particular kind of malware that infects other files\n",
    "\n",
    "* Traditionally, a virus could infect only executable programs\n",
    "* Nowadays, many data document formats can contain executable code (such as macros)\n",
    "    * Many different types of files can be infected with viruses now\n",
    "\n",
    "Typically, when the file is executed (or sometimes just opened), the virus activates, and tries to infect other files with copies of itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this way, the virus can spread between files, or between computers.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Infection\n",
    "\n",
    "The virus wants to modify an existing (non-malicious) program or document (the **host**) in such a way that executing or opening it will transfer control to the virus\n",
    "\n",
    "* The virus can do its \"dirty work\" and then transfer control back the host\n",
    "\n",
    "For executable programs:  \n",
    "Typically, the virus will modify other programs and copy itself to the beginning of the targets' program code.\n",
    "\n",
    "For documents with macros:  \n",
    "The virus will edit other documents to add itself as a macro which starts automatically when the file is opened.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to infecting other files, a virus will often try to infect the computer itself\n",
    "\n",
    "* This way, every time the computer is booted, the virus is automatically activated\n",
    "\n",
    "It might put itself in the boot sector of the hard disk.\n",
    "\n",
    "It might add itself to the list of programs the OS runs at boot time.\n",
    "\n",
    "It might infect one or more of the programs the OS runs at boot time.\n",
    "\n",
    "It might try many of these strategies, but it is still trying to _evade detection_.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Spreading\n",
    "\n",
    "For a virus to spread between computers,\n",
    "\n",
    "* Usually, when the user sends infected files (hopefully not knowing they're infected!) to others\n",
    "    * Or puts them on a p2p network\n",
    "* A virus usually requires some kind of user action in order to spread to another machine\n",
    "    * If it can spread on its own (e.g. via email), it's more likely to be a worm than a virus\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Payload\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to trying to spread, what else might a virus try to do?\n",
    "\n",
    "Some viruses try to evade detection by disabling any active virus scanning software.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most viruses have some sort of **payload**.  \n",
    "At some point, the payload of an infected machine will activate, and something (usually bad) will happen\n",
    "\n",
    "* Erase hard drive\n",
    "* Subtly corrupt some of your spreadsheets\n",
    "* Install a keystroke logger to capture online banking password\n",
    "* Start attacking a particular target website\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Spotting viruses\n",
    "\n",
    "When to look for viruses:\n",
    "\n",
    "* As files are added to the computer\n",
    "    * via portable media\n",
    "    * via a network\n",
    "* From time to time, scan the entire state of the computer\n",
    "    * to catch anything missed when on its way in\n",
    "    * however, any damage the virus have done may not be reversible\n",
    "\n",
    "How to look for viruses:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Signature-based protection\n",
    "* Behaviour-based protection\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Signature-based protection\n",
    "\n",
    "Keep a list of all known viruses.  \n",
    "Each virus has some characteristic feature (the **signature**),\n",
    "\n",
    "* Most signature-based systems use features of the virus code itself\n",
    "    * the infection code\n",
    "    * the payload code\n",
    "* Can also try to identify other patterns characteristics of a particular virus\n",
    "    * where on the system it tries to hide itself\n",
    "    * how it propagates from one place to another\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Polymorphism\n",
    "\n",
    "To try to evade signature-based virus scanners, some viruses are **polymorphic**,\n",
    "\n",
    "* The virus makes a _modified_ copy instead of a _perfect_ copy every time it infects a new file\n",
    "* Often done by having most of the virus code encrypted\n",
    "    * The virus starts with a decryption routine which decrypts the rest of the virus, which is then executed\n",
    "    * When the virus spreads, it encrypts the new copy with a newly chosen random key\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Behaviour-based protection\n",
    "\n",
    "Signature-based protection systems have a major limitation\n",
    "\n",
    "* Can only scan for viruses that are in the list\n",
    "* Several new viruses identified _every day_\n",
    "    * one anti-virus recognizes over _36 million_ signatures\n",
    "\n",
    "Behaviour-based systems look for suspicious patterns of behaviour, rather than for specific code fragments; some systems run suspicious code in a sandbox first.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### False negatives and positives\n",
    "\n",
    "Any kind of test or scanner can have two types of errors:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. False negatives: fail to identify a threat that is present\n",
    "2. False positives: claim a thread is present when it is not\n",
    "\n",
    "Which is worse? How do you think signature-based and behaviour-based systems compare?\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Base rate fallacy\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose a breathalyzer reports false drunkness in 5% of cases, but never fails to detect true drunkness.  \n",
    "Suppose that 1 in every 1000 drivers is drunk (the **base rate**).  \n",
    "If a breathalyzer test of a random driver indicates that he or she is drunk, what is the probability that he or she really is drunk?\n",
    "\n",
    "Applied to a virus scanner, these numbers imply that there will be many more false positives than true positives, potentially causing the true positives to be overlooked or the scanner disabled.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Worms\n",
    "\n",
    "A **worm** is a self-contained piece of code that can replicate with little or no user involvement.  \n",
    "Worms often exploit security flaws in widely deployed software as a path to infection.\n",
    "\n",
    "Typically:\n",
    "\n",
    "* A worm exploits a security flaw in some software on the computer, infecting it\n",
    "* The worm immediately starts searching for other computers to infect\n",
    "* There may or may not be a payload that activates at a certain time, or by another trigger\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The Morris worm\n",
    "\n",
    "First Internet worm, launched by a graduate student at Cornell in 1988.  \n",
    "Once infected, a machine would try to infect other machines in three ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Exploit a buffer overflow in the \"finger\" daemon\n",
    "2. Use a back door left in the \"sendmail\" mail daemon\n",
    "3. Try a \"dictionary attack\" against local users' passwords.  \n",
    "    If successful, log in as them, and spread to other machines they can access without requiring a password\n",
    "\n",
    "All three methods were well known!  \n",
    "First example of buffer overflow exploit in the wild.  \n",
    "Thousands of systems were offline for several days.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The Code Red worm\n",
    "\n",
    "Launched in 2001, exploited a buffer overflow in Microsft's IIS web server (for which a patch had been available for a month).  \n",
    "An infected machine would\n",
    "\n",
    "* Deface its home page\n",
    "* Launch attacks on other web servers (IIS or not)\n",
    "* Launch a DoS attack on a handful of websites, including www.whitehouse.gov\n",
    "* Installed a back door to deter disinfection\n",
    "\n",
    "Infected 250k systems in 9 hours.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The Slammer worm\n",
    "\n",
    "Launched in 2003, performed DoS attacks.  \n",
    "First example of a \"Warhol worm\"; a worm which can infect nearly all vulnerable machines in just 15 minutes.  \n",
    "Exploited a buffer overflow in Microsoft's SQL Server (also having a patch available).  \n",
    "A vulnerable machine could be infected with a single UDP packet!\n",
    "\n",
    "* This enabled the worm to spread extremely quickly\n",
    "* Exponential growth, double every _8.5 seconds_\n",
    "* 90% of vulnerable hosts infected in 10 minutes"
