    "\n",
    "Network architecture is fixed and provides a specific set of services to applications.  \n",

    "Two predominant architectural paradigms:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Client-server\n",
    "    * server\n",
    "        * always-on\n",

    "    * no always-on server\n",
    "    * arbitrary end systems directly communicate\n",
    "    * peers request service from other peers, provide service in return to other peers\n",
    "        * self-scalability -- new peers bring new server capacity, as well as new service demands\n",
    "    * peers are intermittently connected and change IP addresses\n",
    "        * complex management\n",
    "    * three major challenges\n",
    "        1. ISP Friendly. Residential ISPs bandwidth has more downstream than upstream, thus distributing content can put stress on the ISPs\n",

    "\n",
    "**Process**: program running within a host\n",
    "\n",
    "* within same host, two processes communicate using **inter-process communication** (defined by OS)\n",
    "* processes in different hosts communicate by exchanging **messages**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Client and Server Processes\n",
    "\n",
    "**Client process**: process that initiates communication.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Server process**: process that waits to be contacted.\n",
    "\n",
    "Aside: applications with P2P architectures have client processes & server processes.\n",

    "\n",
    "A socket is the interface between the application process and the transport-layer protocol.  \n",
    "The app pushes messages through the socket;\n",
    "the transport-layer protocol has the responsibility of getting the messages to the socket of the receiving process.\n",
    "\n",
    "What are the services that a transport-layer protocol can offer to applications?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Reliable Data Transfer\n",
    "\n",
    "i.e. Data integrity\n",
    "\n",
    "If a protocol provides a guaranteed data delivery service (i.e. data is delivered correctly and completely), it is said to provide **reliable data transfer**.  \n",
    "Some apps _require_ 100% reliable data transfer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another potential service is process-to-process reliable data transfer.\n",
    "\n",
    "If reliable data transfer not provided, this may be acceptable for **loss-tolerant applications**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Throughput\n",
    "\n",
    "Apps with throughput requirements are said to be **bandwidth-sensitive applications**.  \n",
    "e.g., multimedia applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Elastic applications** can make use of as much, or as little, throughput as happens to be available; although more throughput is always better.  \n",
    "e.g., email, file transfer.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Timing\n",
    "\n",
    "Real-time applications require tight timing constraints on data delivery in order to be effective.  \n",
    "e.g., virtual environments, interactive games.\n",
    "\n",
    "For non-real-time applications, no tight constraints on end-to-end delays (but lower delay is better).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Security\n",
    "\n",
    "Transfer protocol can encrypt all data transmitted by the sending process, and in the receiving host, the protocol can decrypt the data before delivering them to the receiving process.  \n",
    "i.e. provides confidentiality.\n",
    "\n",
    "A transport protocol can also provide services such as data integrity and end-point authentication.\n",

    "* Server\n",
    "    * sends (using HTTP) objects in response to requests\n",
    "\n",
    "Uses _TCP_:\n",
    "\n",
    "* client initiates TCP connection (creates socket) to server, default port 80\n",
    "* server accepts TCP connection from client\n",
    "* HTTP messages exchanged between browser and web server\n",
    "* TCP connection closed\n",
    "\n",
    "HTTP is a **stateless** protocol.  \n",
    "Server maintains no info about past client requests.\n",
    "\n",
    "Protocols that maintain \"state\" are complex!\n",
    "\n",
    "* Past history (state) must be maintained\n",
    "* If server/client crashes, their views of \"state\" may be inconsistent, must be reconciled\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.2.2 Non-Persistent and Persistent Connections\n",
    "\n",
    "HTTP uses persistent connections by default.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### HTTP with Non-Persistent Connections\n",
    "\n",
    "Each TCP connection is closed after the server sends the object (and only _one_ object).  \n",
    "For each connection, TCP buffers must be allocated and TCP variables must be kept in both the client and server; possibly significant burden on server.\n",
    "\n",
    "Modern browsers can open multiple (5 to 10) TCP connections in _parallel_, and each connection handles one request-response transaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Round-trip time** (**RTT**): time it takes for a small packet to travel from client to server and then back to client.  \n",
    "This time includes: packet-propagation delays, packet queuing delays, and packet-processing delays.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Three-way handshake\":\n",
    "\n",
    "1. One RTT to initiate TCP connection\n",
    "2. One RTT for HTTP request and first few bytes of HTTP response to return\n",
    "3. Message transmission time\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\text{Non-persistent HTTP response time} = 2 \\text{RTT} + \\text{message transmission time}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### HTTP with Persistent Connections\n",

    "_Subsequent_ requests and responses between the same client and server sent over the _same_ open connection.\n",

    "Although the segment from A is received at B, the acknowledgment from B to A gets lost.  \n",
    "In this case, the timeout event occurs, and Host A retransmits the same segment.  \n",
    "Of course, when Host B receives the retransmission, it observes from the sequence number that the segment contains data that has already been received.  \n",
    "Thus, TCP in Host B will discard the bytes in the retransmitted segment.\n",
    "\n",
    "![scenario 1](Assets/network-3.34.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Scenario 2**\n",
    "\n",
    "Host A sends two segments back to back.  \n",
    "The first segment has sequence number 92 and 8 bytes of data, and the second segment has sequence number 100 and 20 bytes of data.  \n",
    "Suppose that both segments arrive intact at B, and B sends two separate acknowledgments for each of these segments.  \n",
    "The first of these acknowledgments has acknowledgment number 100;\n",
    "the second has acknowledgment number 120.  \n",
    "Suppose now that neither of the acknowledgments arrives at Host A before the timeout.  \n",
    "When the timeout event occurs, Host A resends the first segment with sequence number 92 and restarts the timer.  \n",
    "As long as the ACK for the second segment arrives before the new timeout, the second segment will not be retransmitted.\n",
    "\n",
    "![scenario 2](Assets/network-3.35.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Scenario 3**\n",
    "\n",
    "Host A sends the two segments, exactly as in the second example.  \n",
    "The acknowledgment of the first segment is lost in the network, but just before the timeout event, Host A receives an acknowledgment with acknowledgment number 120.  \n",
    "Host A therefore knows that Host B has received _everything_ up through byte 119;\n",
    "so Host A does not resend either of the two segments.\n",
    "\n",
    "![scenario 3](Assets/network-3.36.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Doubling the Timeout Interval\n",
    "\n",
    "The first concerns the length of the timeout interval after a timer expiration.  \n",
    "In this modification, whenever the timeout event occurs, TCP retransmits the not-yet-acknowledged segment with the smallest sequence number, as described above.  \n",
    "But each time TCP retransmits, it sets the next timeout interval to _twice_ the previous value, rather than deriving it from the last `EstimatedRTT` and `DevRTT`.\n",
    "\n",
    "This modification provides a limited form of congestion control.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Fast Retransmits\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the problems with timeout-triggered retransmissions is that the timeout period can be relatively long.\n",
    "\n",
    "When a segment is lost, this long timeout period forces the sender to delay resending the lost packet $\\to$ increasing the end-to-end delay.  \n",
    "Fortunately, the sender can often detect packet loss well before the timeout event occurs by noting so-called duplicate ACKs.\n",
    "\n",
    "![TCP ACK generation recommendation table](Assets/network-table-3.2.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Because a sender often sends a large number of segments back to back, if one segment is lost, there will likely be many back-to-back duplicate ACKs.  \n",
    "If the TCP sender receives three duplicate ACKs for the same data, it takes this as an indication that the segment following the segment that has been ACKed three times has been lost.  \n",
    "In the case that three duplicate ACKs are received, the TCP sender performs a **fast retransmit**, retransmitting the missing segment before that segment's timer expires.\n",
    "\n",
    "Code replacement:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "event: ACK received, with ACK field value of y\n",
    "    if (y > SendBase) {\n",
    "        SendBase=y\n",
    "        if (there are currently any not yet acknowledged segments)\n",
    "            start timer\n",

    "    }\n",
    "    break;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Go-Back-N or Selective Repeat?\n",
    "\n",
    "A proposed modification to TCP, the so-called **selective acknowledgment** [RFC 2018], allows a TCP receiver to acknowledge out-of-order segments selectively rather than just cumulatively acknowledging the last correctly received, in- order segment.  \n",
    "When combined with selective retransmission -- skipping the retransmission of segments that have already been selectively acknowledged by the receiver -- TCP looks a lot like the SR protocol.  \n",
    "Thus, TCP's error-recovery mechanism is a hybrid of GBN and SR protocols!\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.5.5 Flow Control\n",
    "\n",
    "TCP has a **flow-control service** to its applications to eliminate the possibility of the sender overflowing the receiver's buffer.  \n",
    "Note: not the same as **congestion control**, from congestion within the IP network.\n",
    "\n",
    "The sender maintain a variable called the **receive window**, denoted `RcvBuffer` and typically default sized 4096 bytes (many systems auto-adjust `RcvBuffer`).  \n",

    "TCP is full-duplex $\\to$ the sender at each side of the connection maintains a distinct receive window.  \n",

    "2. The server extracts the TCP SYN segment from the datagram, allocates the TCP buffers and variables to the connection, and sends a connection-granted segment to the client TCP.  \n",
    "   This connection-granted segment also contains no application-layer data, however does contain three important pieces of information in the segment header.  \n",

    "   The connection-granted segment is referred to as a **SYNACK segment**.\n",
    "3. Upon receiving the SYNACK segment, the client also allocates buffers and variables to the connection.  \n",
    "   The client host then sends the server yet another segment;\n",
    "   this last segment acknowledges the server's connection-granted segment (the client does so by putting the value `server_isn + 1` in the acknowledgment field of the TCP segment header).  \n",
    "   The `SYN` bit is set to 0, since the connection is established.  \n",
