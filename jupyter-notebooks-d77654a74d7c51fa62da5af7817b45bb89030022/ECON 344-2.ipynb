    "3. Be ever vigilant to ensure consistency and authenticity in all aspects of the service product, from the largest to smallest detail\n",
    "4. Integrate across all elements (including technical, performance, and business), using structured and unstructured communication mechanisms. Importantly, there should be an emphasis on supporting front-line service providers\n",
    "5. Create a spirit of experimentation and innovation for all service employees by encouraging everyone's involvement in the creative process. Constantly innovating to find better ways to excite the customer is key\n",
